# 10-Bit-Potentiometric-DAC

This project presents the design of a 10 Bit Potentiometric Digital to Analog Converter using end-to-end Open-source EDA tools. The aim is to design a 10-bit potentiometric Digital to Analog Converter(DAC) with 3.3V analog voltage, 1.8V digital voltage  using the sky130nm technology node.

# Opensource Tools used

1. eSim: eSim is a Free and Open source EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, analysis and PCB design developed by FOSSEE, IIT Bombay. It is an integrated tool built using free/libre and open source softwares such as KiCad, Ngspice and GHDL. It serves as an alternative to commercially available/ licensed software like OrCAD, Xpedition and HSPICE. For more info refer: https://esim.fossee.in/home

2. Ngspice: Ngspice is the open source spice simulator for electric and electronic circuits. Ngspice offers a wealth of device models for active, passive, analog, and digital elements. Model parameters are provided by the semiconductor device manufacturers or from semiconductor foundries. The user simply adds his/her circuits as a netlist, and the output is one or more graphs of currents, voltages and other electrical quantities or is saved in a data file. For more info refer: http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/

3. Skywater Pdk: The SkyWater Open Source PDK is a collaboration between Google and SkyWater Technology Foundry to provide a fully open source Process Design Kit and related resources, which can be used to create manufacturable designs at SkyWaterâ€™s facility. As of May 2020, this repository is targeting the SKY130 process node. For more info refer: https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk, https://skywater-pdk.rtfd.io
